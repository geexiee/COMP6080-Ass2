I tried to keep the front end usability as intuitive as possible with clear labels, buttons, and messages for both success/errors. 
Added an alt message to post images to provide a possible explanation/solution for when image aren't loading.
Used accessible colours only
Clear links/highlights on text which leads to other parts of the website (e.g. underline/highlight names of other users so the user knows they can click on it to go to their profile. Cursor also changes on hover)
Removed buttons from view to prevent the user from trying to access functionality they aren't allowed to (e.g. ensure that the delete/update post buttons only appear on the logged in users posts).
